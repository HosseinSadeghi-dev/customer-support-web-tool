## Comments and Ideas for Improvement

- If the project scales in size and complexity, consider migrating to a more robust database framework than SQLite.
- **PostgreSQL** is a great option as it offers advanced features like support for complex queries, better concurrency, and improved performance for larger datasets. It also has strong community support and a wide range of extensions.
- Additionally, we should customize Material UI to better fit the project's design requirements. Creating customized Material UI components will enhance the user experience and ensure a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
